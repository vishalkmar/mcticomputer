              question: 'What is React?',
              answer: 'React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state effectively.'
          },
          {
              question: 'Why should I learn React?',
              answer: 'React is widely used in modern web development, enabling the creation of dynamic, single-page applications with improved performance and user experience.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What is JSX?',
              answer: 'JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create React elements and components.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What are components in React?',
              answer: 'Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be functional or class-based and encapsulate the logic and presentation of the UI.'
          },
          {
              question: 'How does state work in React?',
              answer: 'State is an object that determines the componentâ€™s behavior and rendering. React provides hooks like useState to manage state in functional components.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What is React Router?',
              answer: 'React Router is a library that enables navigation among different components in a React application. It allows for client-side routing and dynamic routing based on the URL.'
          },
          {
              question: 'How can I manage global state in React?',
              answer: 'Global state can be managed using Context API for simple cases or Redux for more complex applications, allowing state to be shared across components.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What are some best practices for optimizing React performance?',
              answer: 'Best practices include code splitting, using React.memo for components, optimizing renders with useMemo and useCallback, and leveraging lazy loading for routes and images.'
