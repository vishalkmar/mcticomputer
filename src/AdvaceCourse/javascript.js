              question: 'What is JavaScript?',
              answer: 'JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for building interactive web applications.'
          },
          {
              question: 'Why should I learn JavaScript?',
              answer: 'JavaScript is essential for web development, enabling you to create dynamic and interactive websites. It is also used in server-side development, mobile app development, and more.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What are variables in JavaScript?',
              answer: 'Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can define variables using var, let, or const keywords, each with different scopes and usage.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What is the DOM?',
              answer: 'The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What are promises in JavaScript?',
              answer: 'Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to handle asynchronous code more effectively than traditional callbacks.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What is the difference between == and ===?',
              answer: 'The == operator checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type (type coercion), while === checks for equality without type conversion (strict equality).'
          },
          {
              question: 'What are closures in JavaScript?',
              answer: 'Closures are functions that have access to their own scope, the outer functionâ€™s scope, and the global scope. They are useful for creating private variables and functions.'
          },
          {
              question: 'What are higher-order functions?',
              answer: 'Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as output. They are commonly used in functional programming patterns in JavaScript.'
